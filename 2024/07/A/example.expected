* `190: 10 19` has only one position that accepts an operator: between `10` and `19`. Choosing `+` would give `29`, but choosing `*` would give the test value (`10 * 19 = 190`).
* `3267: 81 40 27` has two positions for operators. Of the four possible configurations of the operators, two cause the right side to match the test value: `81 + 40 * 27` and `81 * 40 + 27` both equal `3267` (when evaluated left-to-right)!
* `292: 11 6 16 20` can be solved in exactly one way: `11 + 6 * 16 + 20`.

The engineers just need the total calibration result, which is the sum of the test values from just the equations that could possibly be true. In the above example, the sum of the test values for the three equations listed above is `3749`.
